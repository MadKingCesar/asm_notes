Most of the stuff is for old computers including the book, so unless you want to use a program like 86box to emulate and old computer to the fullest, a lot of stuff in here is not going to be to your need, however; the book(s) and notes give you a more grounding understanding of the asm language so I recommend reading them anyway. This repo is mostly for myself, so I don't care a lot about what other people think / use this.

This is mostly notes from books that I've read regarding ASM (actually MASM) the first book I'm currently reading is called Assembly step-by-step by Jeff Dunteman. You can read it for free on archive.org
Programs used are EMU8086 (x86 cpu emulator), godbolt.org (gcc, gnu compiler on the web) and dosbox for emulating windows debugger
