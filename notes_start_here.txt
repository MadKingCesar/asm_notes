Registers are 16 bits in size but require 20 bits to get an address. To get a location in memory you need to put the address into two seperate registers.
One will contain the offset, and the other will contain the segment address (written segment:offset)

//General segments
CS        Code segment (Where code is read and written)
DS        Data segment (Where values are stored, VARS)
ES        Extra segment (Extra space)
SS        Stack segment (Temporary storage of data and addresses)

//General-purpose registers
AX    BX    CX    DX    SP              BP    SI    DI
ACC  BASE  COUNT  DATA  STACKPOINTER
